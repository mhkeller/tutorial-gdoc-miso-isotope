It looks like this:

**Note: Google is in the process of changing how spreadsheet data can be accessed programatically so check the [Miso](http://misoproject.com/dataset/) for updates on support. At alternative is to edit your data in Google Spreadsheets, download them as a csv and then load that file into your client. A good javascript csv parsing library is [dsv](https://github.com/mbostock/dsv).**
